# advice-giver user interface

The goal of this build was to create a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by our group. Our groups app was called Advice Giver. 

## PITCH
This app creates room for an online global community just for you to connect with, and only one call away! You can choose to be the expert advisor, or the one who receives advice, or both! If you get a match, you both decide how to engage in the advisory relationship, assess if the advice is helpful or not, and when to move on—sounds like a normal relationship, right? Try it out! And leave no one behind, because a more connected world should never feel lonely for anyone.

## MVP

Onboarding process and user profile set up for two user types: advisors and those seeking advice.  Might include photo, age, gender, life motto (optional), interests, areas of expertise, certifications (if any), social media links, geographic location, language skills etc)
- Ability to easily edit/update/delete profile info
If account setting is on “get advice”:
- Ability to easily create and post a question (including title,
question, question type (ie business, career advice, personal
development, desired time commitment from and advisor etc.) , and optional stretch goal photos/files). You can also add filters according to preferences (area of expertise, language, gender, years of experience, geographic location etc.); 3) Post as either public ( to appear on question feed) or private.
- tab for the user to view and edit or delete their posted questions (both public and private)
- “Mentor tab” for users to see which advisors have offered to help them
If user type is on “give advice”:
- An advisory feed tab will display questions and requests set on public mode throughout the day. Select a question if interested in advising a person needing advice. If they select a question, their user name and email will be added to that users “mentor tab”

## STRETCH GOALS

Ability for a user to sign up to both give and receive advice. Toggle a view for the logged in user to see different account abilities. (Similar to Airbnb and toggling to host view).
Ability to upload files or photos with a question.
